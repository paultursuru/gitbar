# GitBar
GitBar is an [xbar plugin](https://github.com/matryer/xbar-plugins) that will keep you updated on the branches and open pull requests on one or many repository. It refreshes every minute by default.

# Installation
Git Clone this repo, cd in the folder and run the following commands to install the plugin:

As said above, it is an xbar plugin, so you'll need it installed to use GitBar :
```
brew install --cask xbar
```

GitBar uses `gh` to fetch the latest release of the repo. You will need to install [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) to use GitBar and also login to your github account.
```
brew install gh
gh auth login
```

Inside gitbar_app/config, you'll find a [settings.json.example](https://github.com/paultursuru/gitbar/blob/main/gitbar_app/config/settings.json.example), update the username and repositories list before next step and rename it to `settings.json`.


Finally, there is [a script](https://github.com/paultursuru/gitbar/blob/main/copy_to_plugins.sh) to install the app in xbar plugins. Make this script executable and run it to copy the GitBar plugin inside the xbar plugins folder.
You don't _have_ to use this script, it is just here to make it easier to copy the plugin files to the correct location.
```
chmod +x copy_to_plugins.sh
./copy_to_plugins.sh
```

You can change the refresh rate by changing the "1m" in the name of this file to any other time value 10s, 2h, etc (if you want to do it manually, just rename the file to the new time value and re-run `./copy_to_plugins.sh`).
```
gitbar.10s.rb
gitbar.2h.rb
```
Whenever you need to make changes to the config file, update the `settings.json` file and re-run `./copy_to_plugins.sh`

## Offline mode
Whenever the GitBar runs, it will check if you are connected to the internet. If you are, it will fetch all the data needed and persist it in the `view.json` file.
If you are not, it will display a message in the header and the footer and use the last persisted data in the `view.json` file.
```

## Troubleshooting
If you are having issues with the plugin, please check the following:
- Make sure you are connected to the internet
- Make sure you are logged in to your GitHub account with `gh auth login`
